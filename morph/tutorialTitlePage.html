<h2>Hoplite Challenge</h2>

<br><br>
The Hoplite Challenge is a verb conjugation game for Ancient Greek.  It is inspired by the Hoplite Challenge Cup, a contest held each summer between the students and faculty of the
<a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Latin-Greek-Institute">Latin/Greek Institute</a>'s Basic Program in Greek. After only six weeks in the course, students are prepared to challenge the faculty to see who can quickly and accurately produce Ancient Greek verb.  The spirit and intensity of the Hoplite Challenge Cup could never be adequately recreated in app form, but it is hoped that you will find the app fun and challenging.
<br><br>
The app follows the units of the course's textbook, Hansen &amp; Quinn's <i>Greek: An Intensive Course</i>.  From the 114 verbs introduced in Hansen &amp; Quinn there are over 15,800 possible verb forms, not including additional forms given in the appendix.  The app presents users with a verb form and prompts them to change it to another form; users have 30 seconds to produce this new form.  Users should already have a good command of Ancient Greek verbs in advance; the app is aimed at perfecting and reinforcing this knowledge.<br><br>
<!--
To those not accustomed to generating Greek verb forms from scratch, the game may feel difficult at first, but with a little work you will find it an achievable and worthwhile goal.

The benefits of active knowledge of Greek and Latin morphology has been stressed in multiple very recent sources.
Dickey and Beard.  This has long been recognized by the Latin/Greek Institute.-->
