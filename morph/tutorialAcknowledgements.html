The Hoplite Challenge app is inspired not only by the <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Latin-Greek-Institute">Latin/Greek Institute</a>'s Hoplite Challenge Cup, but also by the methods, textbook, and spirit of the Institute.  As such, a huge thanks is due to the faculty and students of the Institute, past and present.  In particular, thanks is due to the Greek faculty Hardy Hansen, Katia Kosova, our chair Ar√°mis Lopez, and to the Director of the Latin/Greek Institute Katherine Lu Hsu.  Special thanks is due to Hardy Hansen for founding the Greek Program, writing the textbook on which the app is based, and offering many invaluable corrections and suggestions for the app.

<br>
Thanks to all of the beta testers who pointed out bugs and offered helpful suggestions, but especially to Nathan Oglesby and LGI alumnus Zachary Hayworth for particularly useful feedback.
