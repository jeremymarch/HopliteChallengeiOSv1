The Hoplite Challenge app was developed over the past three years as I taught Basic Greek at the <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Latin-Greek-Institute">Latin/Greek Institute</a>.
The app is directly inspired by the Hoplite Challenge Cup, but also by the methods, textbook, and spirit of the Latin/Greek Institute.  As such, a huge thanks is due to the faculty and students of the Institute.  The app simply could not exist without them.  In particular, thanks is due to the Greek faculty Hardy Hansen, Katia Kosova, and our chair Ar√°mis Lopez.  Thanks is also due to Katherine Lu Hsu, the Latin/Greek Institute Director, for encouragement and support.  Special thanks is due to Hardy Hansen for founding the Greek Program, writing the textbook, and offering many invaluable corrections and suggestions for the app.

    I'd like to thank all of the beta testers for their help, but especially Nathan Oglesby and LGI alumnus Zachary Hayworth for especially detailed feedback.

    Any remaining errors are my own. Kindly email me if you spot any and they will be corrected in an update.
