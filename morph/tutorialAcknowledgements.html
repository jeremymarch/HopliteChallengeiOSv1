The Hoplite Challenge app is based not only on the Hoplite Challenge Cup, but also the methods, textbook, and spirit of the <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Latin-Greek-Institute">Latin/Greek Institute</a>.  As such, a huge thanks is due to the faculty and students of the Institute.  The app simply would not exist without LGI.  In particular the Greek faculty Hardy Hansen, Katia Kosova, and chaired by Ar√°mis Lopez.  Katherine Lu Hsu the Latin/Greek Institute Director has been immensely encouraging and supportive.  Rita Fleischer.  Special thanks is due to Hardy Hansen for founding the Greek Program, writing the textbook, and offering invaluable corrections and suggestions on the app.

    This year I had the honor to serve as a Graduate Center Digital Fellow.  I'd like to thank Matt Gold, Lisa Rhody, and my fellow Digital Fellows for support, advice, and creating an environment where digital humanities projects can flourish.

    I'd like to thank the Classics Program at The Graduate Center, CUNY.

    I'd like to thank all of the beta testers who are too numerous to name, but in particular Nathan Oglesby and LGI alumnus Zach Hayworth for especially useful feedback.

    Any remaining errors are my own.
