<h2>Game Play</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Play begins with a conjugated verb form presented at the top.  Using the keyboard, change the given form to the form indicated.</li>
    <li>You will have 30 seconds to produce the form indicated.</li>
    <li>If the indicated form has multiple forms, give them all.  Enter multiple forms by pressing the MF key.  The first press will add 50% more time to the timer to account for the extra difficulty.  Pressing the MF button again will type a comma to separate the forms.</li>
    <li>Verb forms are described by their morphology, e.g. the deponent βούλομαι, which is active in meaning, but has a middle morphology, is described as middle voice.</li>
    
    <li>You will start the game with three "lives," indicated in the top right corner by the <img src="Life4X.png" style="height:18px;width:18px;display:inline;"> symbols.</li>
    <li>If you enter the form incorrectly, you will lose a life and the correct form will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Press Continue and play will resume starting from a new verb.</li>
    <li>  If you enter the form correctly, you will earn points for this form and a new change will be asked using your entered form as the starting point. Once you get three forms correct from a single verb you earn bonus points and play resumes with a new verb.</li>
    

<li>Before the start of each game you can select which Hansen &amp; Quinn units you would like to include in your game.  From the Main Menu go to Settings to turn on or off units.  In Play mode the game will include any verb from highest selected unit and under, so selecting unit 5 will also include units 1-4.
    In practice mode the app will include verbs only from the units selected, so you can concentrate on verbs from just one unit for extra practice.</li>
<li>When only units 1 and/or 2 are selected, only one change will be made to each verb form.  When a higher unit is selected, two changes will be made for each new form.</li>


    <li>For each correctly conjugated form you will receive points equal to the highest selected unit, e.g. if the highest selected unit is 19, you will receive 19 points per correct answer. By answering three changes to one verb correctly you will receive a bonus equal to the higest unit.</li>
    <li>Once you lose all your lives the game is over.</li>

    <li>The game does not currently ask for any periphrastic forms, these will be added in a later version.</li>
    <li>The game also does not ask for the base form of verbs which require a prefix such as <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-ἔβην</span>.</li>
    </ul>
