        <div class="subtitle">Game Play</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the given form to the form indicated; you will have 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Correct forms earn points and a new change will be asked using the entered form as the starting point. After four correct forms from the same verb, a bonus is awarded and play resumes from a new verb.</li>
            <li>Incorrect forms will cost a life; the correct form will be displayed below.  Press Continue to resume play with a new verb.</li>
            <li>You start the game with three lives, indicated in the top right corner by this symbol <img src="Life4X.png" style="height:18px;width:18px;display:inline;">. The game continues until you lose all of your lives.</li>
            <li>Forms are described by their morphology. For example, the deponent <span class="greek">ἐβουλήθην</span>
                which is active in meaning, but passive in morphology, is described as passive.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">H&amp;Q Units</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Before the start of each game you can select which Hansen &amp; Quinn units you would like to include in your game.  From the Main Menu go to Settings to turn on or off units.
                <ul><li>In Play mode the game will include any verb from the highest selected unit and under, so selecting unit 5 will also include units 1-4.</li>
                    
                    <li>In practice mode the app will only include verbs from the units selected, so you can concentrate on verbs from just one unit for extra practice.</li></ul></li>
            
            <li>When only units 1 and/or 2 are selected, only one change will be made to each verb form.  When a higher unit is selected, two changes will be made for each new form.</li>
            
            <li>The game does not currently ask for periphrastic forms.</li>
            <li>The game does not currently ask for the base form of verbs which require a prefix such as <span class="greek" style="white-space: nowrap;">-ἔβην</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Multiple Forms</div>
        <ul>
            <li>If the indicated form has multiple forms, give them all.  Enter multiple forms by pressing the MF key.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first press will add 50% more time to the timer to account for the extra difficulty.</li>
                    <li>Pressing the MF button again will type a comma to separate the forms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li></ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Scoring</div>
        <ul>
            <li>For each correctly conjugated form you will receive points equal to the highest selected unit. For example, if the highest selected unit is 19, you will receive 19 points per correct answer. After entering four correct forms from the same verb, you will receive bonus points equal to the highest selected unit.</li>
        </ul>
