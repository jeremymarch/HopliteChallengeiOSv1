<ul>
    <li>You are presented with a conjugated verb form.  </li>
    <li>Using the keyboard, change the given form to the form indicated. If you get a form incorrect, a new verb will be chosen.  </li>
    <li>Select the Hansen &amp; Quinn units you would like to include. In Play mode the game will select any verb under the highest unit selected.
        In practice mode the app will select verbs only from the units selected.</li>
    <li>For units 1 and 2 only one change will be made to each verb.  For higher units two changes will be made for each new form.</li>
    <li>You will have 30 seconds to conjugate the new verb form.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple forms, give all.  If there are multiple forms pressing the MF key will give you 50% extra time to enter all of the forms.  Pressing the button subsequent times types a comma to separate the forms.</li>
        <li>For each correctly answered you will receive a point value equal to the highest selected unit. If you answer three changes to one verb correctly you will receive a bonus equal to the higest unit.</li>
