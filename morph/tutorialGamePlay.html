<ul>
    <li>Change the given form to the form indicated; you will have 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>If the indicated form has multiple forms, give them all.  Enter multiple forms by pressing the MF key.  <ul><li>The first press will add 50% more time to the timer to account for the extra difficulty.</li>
        <li>Pressing the MF button again will type a comma to separate the forms.</li></ul></li>
    <li>Forms are described by their morphology, e.g. the deponent <span class="greek">ἐβουλήθην</span>
        which is active in meaning, but passive in morphology, is described as passive.</li>
    
    <li>Correct forms earn points and a new change will be asked using the entered form as the starting point. Three forms correct from a single verb will earn bonus points and play resumes with a new verb.</li>
    <li>Incorrect forms will cost a life; the correct form will be displayed at the below.  Press Continue and play will resume with a new verb.</li>

    <li>You start the game with three "lives," indicated in the top right corner by the <img src="Life4X.png" style="height:18px;width:18px;display:inline;"> symbols. The game continues until you lose all of your lives.</li>

<li>Before the start of each game you can select which Hansen &amp; Quinn units you would like to include in your game.  From the Main Menu go to Settings to turn on or off units.  In Play mode the game will include any verb from the highest selected unit and under, so selecting unit 5 will also include units 1-4.
    In practice mode the app will include verbs only from the units selected, so you can concentrate on verbs from just one unit for extra practice.</li>
<li>When only units 1 and/or 2 are selected, only one change will be made to each verb form.  When a higher unit is selected, two changes will be made for each new form.</li>


    <li>For each correctly conjugated form you will receive points equal to the highest selected unit, e.g. if the highest selected unit is 19, you will receive 19 points per correct answer. By answering three changes to one verb correctly you will receive a bonus equal to the higest unit.</li>

    <li>The game does not currently ask for any periphrastic forms, these will be added in a later version.</li>
    <li>The game does not currently ask for the base form of verbs which require a prefix such as <span class="greek" style="white-space: nowrap;">-ἔβην</span>.</li>
    </ul>
