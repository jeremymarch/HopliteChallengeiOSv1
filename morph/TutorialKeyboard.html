<ul>
    <li>Accents should be keyed after their vowel and can be entered in any order.  Pressing the same accent key again toggles off the accent; pressing a mutually exclusive accent will replace the original accent with the second. Don't forget those macrons!</li>
    <li>Press the MF button if there are multiple forms.  The first press gives you 50% more time, subsequent presses add commas to separate the forms. If there is only one form, though, pressing MF will immediately result the attempt being marked incorrect, so use it with caution!</li>
    <li>For a nu-movable, press the nu key followed by the () key.</li>
    <li>You can move the cursor back in the word to add an accent or make a correction by holding your finger over the word for a couple of seconds.  A magnifying lense is displayed to help you place the cursor.
